# Get started

Welcome all to the Tepsi Design system (WIP).
Tepsi is a reusable component library that helps SDWorx developers build UIs faster. The goal is to make building durable UIs more productive and satisfying.

# Get started as Developer

### What?
All components are written in React or JSX, and its stories are written in [Component Story Format](https://medium.com/storybookjs/component-story-format-66f4c32366df). It requires Storybook version 5.2-beta and up.

## Run and develop locally
Clone the [project](https://bitbucket.org/<<sdworx>>/<<tepsi>>.git) then start Storybook.

`yarn && yarn run storybook`

## Use
Import components you want into your UI

`import { Button, Badge } from â€˜@sd/tepsi;`

and use them like so

```
  const example = () => (
    <div>
      <Button appearance="primary" onClick={() => 0}>Do something</Button>
      <Badge onClick={this.clear}>Cool</Badge>
    </div>
  )
```

### Browse SDS components in your own Storybook
Once you add the package, update your .storybook/config.js to import all files ending in .stories.js.

```
  import { configure } from '@storybook/react';
  configure(require.context('../src', true, /.stories.js$/), module);
```
